## :tv: TV GRP Weights Forecasting Model 
This model helps in forecasting TV GRP weights based on the historical category data using open-source Prophet library by Meta.

It employs an additive regression model having four constituents at its core:

1- A curve for detecting changes in trends of the GRPs by picking variation-points from the time-series data

2- A yearly seasonal component (uses Fourier series)

3- A weekly seasonal component

4- A list representing country holiday effects in the data - currently for Malaysia
